      <description>McGill has announced that the Fall 2020 semester will be offered primarily through remote delivery. Here&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re doing to accommodate the current situation:
Will the hackathon be hosted remotely? Yes, CodeJam 2020 will proceed remotely. More details will follow shortly! üî•
Can I attend CodeJam if I&amp;rsquo;m not in Montreal? We encourage you to register even if you&amp;rsquo;re not physically in Montreal. You will have full access to the remote hackathon; the only obstacle will be the difference in timezone.</description>

      <description>We are happy to announce that Digital by Default is the theme for this year‚Äôs CodeJam. With the current global situation, the technology sector has been forced into a pivotal moment in time.
The technologies that emerge in the coming months will redefine the way we work, the way we socialize, and more than likely many other factors of our lives that we have yet to consider. As such, this year‚Äôs CodeJam aims to put students in the spotlight of this worldwide technological revolution and to provide them with the platform necessary to explore their innovative ideas.</description>
