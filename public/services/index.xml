      <description>McGill has announced that the Fall 2020 semester will be offered primarily through remote delivery. Here&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re doing to accommodate the current situation:
Will the hackathon be hosted remotely? Yes, CodeJam 2020 will proceed remotely. More details will follow shortly! ðŸ”¥
Can I attend CodeJam if I&amp;rsquo;m not in Montreal? We encourage you to register even if you&amp;rsquo;re not physically in Montreal. You will have full access to the remote hackathon; the only obstacle will be the difference in timezone.</description>
