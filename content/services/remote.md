McGill has announced that the Fall 2020 semester will be offered primarily through remote delivery. Here's what we're doing to accommodate the current situation:

## Will the hackathon be hosted remotely?

Yes, CodeJam 2020 will proceed remotely. More details will follow shortly! ðŸ”¥

## Can I attend CodeJam if I'm not in Montreal?

We _encourage_ you to register _even if_ you're not physically in Montreal. You will have full access to the remote hackathon; the only obstacle will be the difference in timezone. Get ready with a cup of coffee! â˜•

## Are company representatives going to be present at CodeJam 2020?

We thank all of your sponsors for accommodating the current situation. Although we cannot host an in-person tech fair, rest assured that:

- Mentors will be available online to help you with your project
- Recruiters will host information sessions and fireside chats
- Workshops will be provided remotely
