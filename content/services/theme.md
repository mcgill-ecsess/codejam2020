We are happy to announce that **DIGITAL BY DEFAULT** is the theme for this year’s CodeJam. With the current global situation, the technology sector has been forced into a pivotal moment in time. The technologies that emerge in the coming months will redefine the way we work, the way we socialize, and more than likely many other factors of our lives that we have yet to consider. As such, this year’s CodeJam aims to put students in the spotlight of this worldwide technological revolution and to provide them with the platform necessary to explore their innovative ideas.

You might be wondering what _Digital by Default_ means for our hackathon. It means that our hackathon will be fully remote, and that we will be welcoming more students than ever before by waiving our entrance fee and our geographic restrictions. It also means that you can send us your swag, and that we will take care of getting it to our students. You will have access to our discord, where you can see what our participants are working on and give them a helping hand. Our technology fair will be digital, and we will be helping you set up 1:1 conversations with the students.

2020 provides a unique set of challenges, and we believe that the student community is equipped with the skills, creativity, and enthusiasm necessary to solve these challenges. We hope that you will consider joining us for an exciting 10th edition of CodeJam!
