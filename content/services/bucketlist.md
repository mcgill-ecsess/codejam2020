CodeJam is all about learning and working towards new interests or goals. But just in case you're stuck, we have curated a list of "ideas" to help you get started. Feel free to take a peek and adapt any of these starting points towards your interests!

## Bucketlist

- **Remote learning** - how can you improve the remote learning experience? How can you facilitate the online teaching experience?

- **Automating your home** - what are some chores you dislike? How can you automate them? How could you help roommates divide chores and costs?
